    <h1><a href="#tutorial">This is a programming tutorial.</a></h1>

    <p>
      This is a fully functional implementation of the game of mahjong,
      with competitive computer players, made for two reasons. The first
      being that I like mahjong and I wanted to be able to play it on
      a computer without having to install any software for that, and
      the second being that it's a great example by which to explain how
      to go about writing software that isn't trivial. We've all seen
      tutorials for writing a "todo app", or "a single web page", but
      those aren't things you'd actually want to write if you were to
      make something: they're simple toy exercises to show off "how
      easily you can make something". The problem is that tutorials
      like this gloss over the fact that actually making something rather
      than doing a simple exercise isn't easy. Writing software is hard.
    </p>

    <p>
      And because it's hard, being told that it's easy also makes it
      really easy to forget to plan for hardship: once you find something
      you <em>actually</em> want to do, you soon discover that just
      following the same methodology of that easy, toy implementation
      makes you run into all kinds of obstacles, and if you're not
      careful, or you don't have someone to help you get on track,
      that thing you wanted to make just grinds to a halt before it
      gets abandoned altogether. Tutorials don't teach you how to
      plan for work you know is going to take more than a few days
      to get done, so what if there was a tutorial that did? A
      tutorial that covered the space <em>between</em> toy problems
      and product programming as a day job? That's where this comes in.
    </p>

    <p style="display: none">
      And not just because of the amount of code involved, it's also
      because you need to understand how much you can break up the work,
      when to recognise you're going too many different things, and
      when to abandon something that just doens't seem to want to work
      so that you can try a different approach. Programming is hard,
      you're going to fail at <em>some</em> point, and it would be super
      nice if there was a tutorial that didn't just tell you want to do,
      but also told you what failure looks like, so you can spot it,
      and maybe even avoid it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game you can play, above, took about two months to write in
      my spare time, and I'm going to assume you'll be doing the same,
      because you probably already have a job, or you're attending school,
      and you don't have the luxury of spending 16 hours a day on personal
      projects. So: if you want to learn to program something non-trivial,
      and you understand that this means you'll probably be working on it
      for a couple of weeks, or even a month or two: this might just be
      the tutorial for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, if you just came here to <em>play</em> mahjong, then
      as an added bonus, you can! Keep reading for an explanation of
      how mahjong works, and specifically which rule set and scoring
      system this particular implementation of mahjong supports.

    <h1><a href="#explanation">The how of Mahjong</a></h1>

    <p>
      Mahjong is a four player tile game where players compete to form a
      winning "hand" of 14 tiles, arranged (in general) as four triplets
      (either consecutive tiles within the same suit, or genuine triplets with
      the same tile three times), and a pair (one tile, twice).
    </p>

    <p>
      The traditional game uses 144 tiles, consisting of three numbered suits,
      seven types of "honour" tile split into "winds" and "dragons", and two
      sets of bonus tiles. Specifically:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Four sets of the numerical tiles 1 through 9 with "dots" ornamentation (traditionally called 筒, "coin"):
        </p>
        <div>
          <dots-one></dots-one>
          <dots-two></dots-two>
          <dots-three></dots-three>
          <dots-four></dots-four>
          <dots-five></dots-five>
          <dots-six></dots-six>
          <dots-seven></dots-seven>
          <dots-eight></dots-eight>
          <dots-nine></dots-nine>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Four sets of the numerical tiles 1 through 9 with "bamboo"/"sticks" ornamentation (traditionally called 索, "coin string"):
        </p>
        <div>
          <bamboo-one></bamboo-one>
          <bamboo-two></bamboo-two>

          <bamboo-eight></bamboo-eight>
          <bamboo-nine></bamboo-nine>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Four sets of the numerical tiles 1 through 9 with "Chinese character" ornamentation (traditionally called 萬, "10,000"):
        </p>
        <div>
          <characters-one></characters-one>
          <characters-two></characters-two>

          <characters-seven></characters-seven>
          <characters-eight></characters-eight>
          <characters-nine></characters-nine>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Four sets of the four cardinal "wind" directions:
        </p>
        <div>
          <east-wind></east-wind>
          <south-wind></south-wind>
          <west-wind></west-wind>
          <north-wind></north-wind>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Four sets of "dragon" tiles:
        </p>
        <div>
          <green-dragon></green-dragon>
          <red-dragon></red-dragon>
          <white-dragon></white-dragon>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With eight bonus tiles (not part of play - they are set aside
      immediately when drawn, with a new tile drawn to replace it):
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The four seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter, or 春, 夏, 秋, 冬)
        </p>
        <div>

          <season-four></season-four>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The four seasonal flowers (orchid, plum blossom, bamboo,
          chrysanthenum, or 蘭, 梅, 竹, 菊)
        </p>
        <div>

          <flower-four></flower-four>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="gameplay">
    <h2><a href="#gameplay">Game play</a></h2>

    <p>
      Core game play is about as simple as it gets: everyone starts with 13
      tiles, and players take turns in which they draw a tile from the set of
      undealt tiles, check to see if they can form a winning pattern, and if
      not, discard one of their tiles so they're back at 13, after which it
      is the next player's turn.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "actual game" part, rather than "random chance" aspect comes in the
      form of "claims", where players may claim a tile as it is being
      discarded if they can use that tile to form certain sets. In this case,
      it immediately becomes their turn, irrespective of whose turn it
      "should" have been, and rather than drawing a tile from the undealt
      tiles, they take the discarded tile as their 14<sup>th</sup> tile.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="rules">
    <h2><a href="#rules">Rules around claiming discards</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        if a player has two identical tiles in their hand, they may claim a
        third tile when another player discards it. This is called a "pung".
      </li>
      <li>
        if a player has three identical tiles in their hand, they may claim
        the fourth tile when another player discards it. This is called a
        "kong".
      </li>
      <li>
        if a player is waiting for a specific tile to win, they may claim that
        winning tile when another player discards it regardless of what the
        tile is needed for and whether that would be a legal claim if the
        player were not winning on it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If none of the above claims are made, then the player whose turn it is
      next is allowed to pick up the discard tile rather than drawing a tile
      from the undealt tiles, in order to form a set consisting of three
      consecutive numbers within the same suit, called a "chow". Note that
      these sets are typically worth no points, and will typically even
      negatively impact the hand score by ruling out scores based on true-set
      hand patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the case when a tile has claims by multiple players, a winning claims
      trump any other claims, and a real claim trumps a player wishing to form
      a set of consecutive tiles.
    </p>

    <p>
      When honouring a claim, the receiving player <strong>must</strong>
      reveal all tiles in the set they formed, and put those tiles aside,
      face-up. These tiles are considered "locked", and can no longer be used
      for anything, with a single exception:
    </p>

    <p>
      If a player has a locked, true set of three tiles already on the table,
      and they draw (not claim) the fourth tile, they are allowed to add that
      tile to their locked set of three, forming a locked set of four. If a
      player elects to do this, they receive a new tile from the undealt set
      of tiles to compensate for the "loss" of a tile. If a player forgets to
      do this, they they will not have enough tiles left to form a winning
      hand, and may even be penalized for playing a hand with the wrong number
      of tiles.
    </p>

    <h2 id="rule-clarification"><a href="#rule-clarification">Rule clarifications</a></h2>

    <p>
      A player is <em>not required</em> to declare sets if they do not need to
      claim a tile for them. If a player has a set of three or four tiles in
      their hand, due to having started the game with them, or having drawn
      tiles over a number of turns to end up with them in hand, they are under
      no obligation to reveal that fact. Winning with unrevealed tiles
      typically incurs a bonus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that there are special considerations when a player has four of the
      same tile in their hand. They may declare this and lock the four tiles
      as a set that is no longer in their hand, receiving an extra tile to
      prevent them from having too few tiles to form a winning hand (revealing
      the tiles depending on the exact rules being played. Some rules do not
      require this kind of set to be revealed, meaning other players will not
      know which tile has become unavailable, and so may try to win on a tile
      that cannot ever appear during that round of play). They may also elect
      to keep all four tiles in their hand so that three of the tiles can be
      used as one set, and the fourth tile can be used to form a numerical
      set. Note that because a winning hand has to consist of four sets and a
      pair, a player who wishes to count all four tiles as a single set will
      <em>have</em> to declare that set, or they will not have enough tiles
      with which to form the necessary number of sets and pair.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="scoring">
    <h2><a href="#scoring">Scoring</a></h2>

    <p>
      Scoring of hands is entirely dependent on the style of mahjong played,
      but can be split into two ways to count points:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>points and doublings</em>, in which players gain points for
        individual sets, and score doublings for particular combinations of
        sets. Typically this scoring system has an "upper limit", limiting how
        many points players can score per hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>faan</em>, in which player's hands are assigned a "hand score"
        based on specific sets and patterns of sets, and this hand score is
        then translated into a player score based on a rule-dependent mapping.
        Typically this scoring system has both an upper limit, to fix how many
        points players can score per hand, as well as a "lower limit", in
        which getting a higher hand score does not alter the resulting player
        score for several steps. E.g. a hand worth 5 or 6 faan may both score
        as 5 faan, with a hand worth 7 faan assigned a higher score.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Additionally, rules typically use one of two "score settling" methods:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Winner takes all, in which the winner is paid their player score by
        the other players. In this system, winning is more important than
        forming high scoring hand patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Everyone pays everyone, in which the winning player is paid their
        score by the other players, and the other players all pay each other
        based on the difference in scoring. In this system, forming high
        scoring hand patterns is more important than just winning.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="this-game">
    <h1><a href="#this-game">About this particular implementation</a></h1>

      Because of the payment rules explained above, a hand score leads to
      a total winnings of either 4x the points when winning off of a discard
      (discarding player pays double, the other two players pay the base
      score), or 6x the points when declaring a self-drawn win (all other
      players pay double).
